            <p><br>
                The communities targeted to empower in this survey are UCLA students from any 
                financial background, who have previously or currently held a job on campus 
                in order to support themselves. This project is meant to shed light on this 
                issue and make the UCLA community more aware of the problems caused by balancing
                a job and academics on working students. We hope that student workers at UCLA utilize
                this website to find others in a similar situation and feel a sense of community, and 
                that others can view the site and listen to the narratives of student workers at UCLA.
                </p>

            <h1 id="subheading">More Information</h1>
            <h2 id="subheading">Students surveyed</h2>
            <p>Students here at UCLA get jobs for many different reasons, as evidenced by clicking through
                the interactive map. The goal of our website is to create a community for student workers at UCLA
                to share their stories and struggles, even though financial situations are usually a stigmatized subject
                not often discussed. Since our website is completely anonymous, we hope that students feel comfortable
                sharing their stories. Contact us <a href = "contact.html">here</a> with any suggestions or feedback.
            </p>
            <h2 id="subheading">Future uses</h2>
            <p>We hope that this website can be utilized in the future as a database/library for student worker unions to
                supplement their activism and fight for better benefits of student workers, and even work towards better
                financial aid/grant offers. Students are often pressured to work part-time jobs to relieve the
                financial burden of their family, which causes stress and takes away time from them for studies and social life.
                We hope that not only the student worker community at UCLA sees this website, but also others at UCLA will 
                learn more about their peers.

            <h2> about this website >:p</h2>
            <p >Hello! We wanted to create a space for student workers at UCLA 
                to share their stories and struggles when it comes to working while being
                a student. To read these students' stories, interact with the map by clicking on the chart, based on if you 
                would like to view stories from students working on or off campus, and then based on 
                why a student got a job. If you are comfortable with it, 
                <a href="https://forms.gle/LYtJZmCtVCqpeRBm9">take our survey</a> to add your own response! Scroll down
