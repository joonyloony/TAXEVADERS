            <h1 id="subheading">UCLA STUDENT WORKER MAP</h1>
                <h2 id=""subheading2>Project Objective</h2>
                <p>We are looking at student workers at UCLA and how their jobs affect them. 
                Working at a job while also having time to focus on academics, extracurriculars, professional development, 
                social time, and more is something that many students at UCLA struggle with, but because talking about 
                financials is such a taboo subject in today's society, student workers may not feel comfortable discussing 
                these issues. Therefore, we wanted to create a website where student workers feel comfortable sharing their 
                narratives on how working has impacted them, and to create a community of student workers in similar situations. 
                Moreover, we believe that the lack of discussion on the difficulties of student workers results in UCLA administration
                turning a blind eye to these struggles, so we hope to uplift and promote the voices of student workers and take steps
                to showing UCLA administration that there is much improvement to be made, whether it is improving working conditions, general
                support of the mental and physical health of student workers, wages, or more!
                </p>
                <h2 id=""subheading2>Who are we trying to empower?</h2>
                <p>The communities targeted to empower in this survey are UCLA students from any 
                financial background, who have previously or currently held a job on campus 
                in order to support themselves. This project is meant to shed light on this 
                issue and make the UCLA community more aware of the problems caused by balancing
                a job and academics on working students. We hope that student workers at UCLA utilize
                this website to find others in a similar situation and feel a sense of community, and 
                that others can view the site and listen to the narratives of student workers at UCLA.
                We understand there may be ethical concerns that come with developing this tool because 
                we are collecting sensitive information, as well as the address of our respondants' workplace, 
                but to combat this potential issue we will keep our survey 100% anonymous and allow people to 
                delete their responses if they feel any such need to. Moreover, we decided to not disclose each student's 
                specific concerns with UCLA administration and their reason why they decided to get a job in order to protect their privacy.  
                </p>
                <h2 id=""subheading2>What technology was used?</h2>
                <p>We use open source software including Leaflet and Papaparse as well as HTML, Javascript, 
                    and CSS and in order to create our webpage! We collect and view our data using Google surveys and 
                    Google Sheets. 
                </p>

            <h1 id="subheading">MORE INFORMATION</h1>
            <h2 id="subheading2">Students surveyed</h2>
            <p>Students here at UCLA get jobs for many different reasons, as evidenced by clicking through
                the interactive map. The goal of our website is to create a community for student workers at UCLA
                to share their stories and struggles, even though financial situations are usually a stigmatized subject
                not often discussed. Since our website is completely anonymous, we hope that students feel comfortable
                sharing their stories. Contact us <a href = "contact.html">here</a> with any suggestions or feedback.
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="subheading2">Future uses</h2>
            <p>We hope that this website can be utilized in the future as a database/library for student worker unions to
                supplement their activism and fight for better benefits of student workers, and even work towards better
                financial aid/grant offers. Students are often pressured to work part-time jobs to relieve the
                financial burden of their family, which causes stress and takes away time from them for studies and social life.
                We hope that not only the student worker community at UCLA sees this website, but also others at UCLA will 
                learn more about their peers.

            <h2> Welcome to UCLA Student Worker Map! :D</h2> <br>
            <p > The UCLA Student Worker Map is a space for student workers at UCLA 
                to anonymously share their stories and feelings about their experiences from working part-time jobs while they are a student at UCLA. 
                If you are interested in learning more about these our respondants' stories, please interact with the map by either clicking 
                on the chart's datapoints to see where our respondants are working and what kind of student they are, or feel free to click around
                on our graphs to learn more about a certain demographic! Moreover, if you are a UCLA student-worker and comfortable with sharing your story, 
                <a href="https://forms.gle/LYtJZmCtVCqpeRBm9">take our survey</a> to add your own anonymous response! <br><br><b>Scroll down
