            <p><br>
                The communities targeted to empower in this survey are UCLA students from any 
                financial background, who have previously or currently held a job on campus 
                in order to support themselves. This project is meant to shed light on this 
                issue and make the UCLA community more aware of the problems caused by balancing
                a job and academics on working students.
                </p>

            <h1 id="subheading">More information about our surveyed students</h1>
            <p>Students here at UCLA get jobs for many different reasons, as evidenced by clicking through
                the interactive map. This website creates a place for student workers to share their stories and
                struggles, and show that if you are struggling with having a job, you are not alone. Many others face 
                the same challenges as you, and there are resources to help you succeed! <a href="https://counseling.ucla.edu/">CAPS</a>
                is an option for UCLA students.

            <h2> about this website >:p</h2>
            <p >Hello! We wanted to create a space for student workers at UCLA 
                to share their stories and struggles when it comes to working while being
                a student. To read these students' stories, interact with the map by clicking on the chart, based on if you 
                would like to view stories from students working on or off campus, and then based on 
                why a student got a job. If you are comfortable with it, 
                <a href="https://forms.gle/LYtJZmCtVCqpeRBm9">take our survey</a> to add your own response! Scroll down
                for more information!
