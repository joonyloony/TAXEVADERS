                <p>This website was created by Jenny Lu and Ananya Kodali in spring 2022 for their Asian Am 191A final project! We were inspired to make this mapplication
                    by our shared experiences of working part-time while in school, and the pressures that it places on us (not to mention the fact we get taxed >:[!). 
                    We know that money is a generally taboo thing to talk about and many students don't neccesarily feel comfortable sharing their stories without a sense of
                   anonymity. Our mapplication seeks to remove any nervousness about privacy, and shares the collective struggles of student workers around UCLA while respecting
                   our survey-takers' privacy! There are many reasons for students to decide to get a job, whether it is by choice or required by financial aid or in order to 
                   afford the expensive Los Angeles housing, and we seek to learn more about our community as well as hear from our community on how UCLA can act to assist student 
                   workers and relieve some pressures off of them.

                     <p>Hi I'm Ananya! I am a second year chemical engineering student at UCLA from Toledo, Ohio. I am involved in the chemical 
                         engineering society, a fashion club, and a research lab here at UCLA. My first job was at a smoothie and food cafe in high school.
